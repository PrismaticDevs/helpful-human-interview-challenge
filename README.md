## Description

This app is to meant demonstrate some of my full stack web development skills to Helpful Human via their applicant interview challenge.

I interviewed with the company on 5/4, began building the application on 5/5, and then finished the application on 5/10. Each day I would spend roughly 4-5 hours on developing the code and testing it.
